## 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a program that generates random messages. 

We choose to create random messages about Raquel and Emile, a couple that is getting married in 2021. The users can get a random 'fun fact' about Emile and Raquel by running the program. 

After the first 'fun fact' the users can continue to run the program or to leave the program. If the user decides to continue running the program, a new fun fact will be created and the user will be asked again whether they want to continue getting fun facts. 

## 2. Technologies used

Javascript
Visual studio code
Github

## 3. How to launch and system requirements

For running the program Node.js needs to be installed. If node.js is not installed, it can be downloaded https://nodejs.org/en/ [here] (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once node.js is installed, the program can be launched by running the following command: node mixedmessages.js

## 4. Example of use

The program will launch in the console and ask the user whether or not they want to know a fun fact. If the user answers yes, the program will give a random fun fact from an array. If the user answers another question, an error message will show. 

After the user has got a first fun fact, the user will be asked whether he or she wants to recieve a new fun fact. If not, the program will end. If the user answers yes, the program will generate a new fun fact. This process keeps running untill the player answers no and decides to leave the program.
